<h4>Who can use the REDCap system in NHG?</h4>
<p>Only Staff of National Healthcare Group and her Institutions are eligible
to use the NHG-REDCap system.</p>
<p></p>
<p>NHG Staff should note that REDCap User Accounts are not automatically
issued. You will need to submit your REDCap User Account Request here <em>(NHG Intranet access required)</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you are from another Public Healthcare Cluster/Institution (ie: NUHS
or SHS), we recommend that you check with your Clinical Research Unit/Office
to see how you can get access to your Institution's REDCap system to support
your research activity.</p>
