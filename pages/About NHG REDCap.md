<h4>What is REDCap?</h4>
<p>REDCap is an easy-to-use web application designed to support electronic
data capture for research studies. REDCap was developed by staff at Vanderbilt
University in 2004 in order to help researchers manage data for small/medium
sized projects in a systematic manner.</p>
<p>With its user-friendly and menu driven interface, REDCap is intended to
be a primarily "Self-Service" and easy-to-use tool where researchers can
develop and deploy a REDCap Project with minimal IT Support.</p>
<p>Users can quickly and easily learn to use REDCap via the Tutorial videos,
a built-in frequently asked questions knowledge bank, and embedded documentation.
These guides all work together to guide the researcher in the learning
and use of the system.</p>
<p>Researchers can quickly create web-based databases and data capture forms
with special features like real-time data entry validation and easily export
the collected data for analysis, without the need for in-depth technical
knowledge.</p>
