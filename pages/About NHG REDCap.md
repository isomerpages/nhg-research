<p>REDCap is an easy-to-use web application designed to support electronic
data capture for research studies. REDCap was developed by staff at Vanderbilt
University in 2004 in order to help researchers manage data for small/medium
sized projects in a systematic manner.</p>
<p>REDCap is intended to be a primarily "Self-Service" tool where researchers
can develop and deploy a REDCap Project with minimal IT Support. Users
are expected to learn to use REDCap via the Tutorial videos, a built-in
frequently asked questions knowledge bank, and embedded documentation.
These guides all work together to guide the researcher in the learning
and use of the system.</p>
<p>Researchers can quickly create web-based databases and data capture forms
with special features like real-time data entry validation and easily export
the collected data for analysis, without the need for in-depth technical
knowledge.</p>
<p>The REDCap Consortium is composed of 1,920 active institutional partners
in 103 countries who utilize and support REDCap in various ways. The National
Healthcare Group (NHG) is a member of the REDCap consortium.</p>
<p>NHG's REDCap system was first launched in 2016 and is jointly administered
and maintained by the NHG Group Research &amp; Innovation and Synapxe.</p>
